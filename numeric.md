# Numeric Operators #

**Arithmetic Operators**:

1. `+` : Addition
2. `-` : Subtraction
3. `*` : Multiplication
4. `/` : Division (floating-point division)
5. `//`: Floor Division (integer division)
6. `%` : Modulo (remainder after division)
7. `**`: Exponentiation (raising a number to a power)

**Comparison Operators**:

8. `==`: Equal to
9. `!=`: Not equal to
10. `<` : Less than
11. `>` : Greater than
12. `<=`: Less than or equal to
13. `>=`: Greater than or equal to

**Assignment Operators**:

14. `=` : Assignment
15. `+=`: Add and assign
16. `-=`: Subtract and assign
17. `*=`: Multiply and assign
18. `/=`: Divide and assign
19. `//=`: Floor divide and assign
20. `%=`: Modulo and assign
21. `**=`: Exponentiate and assign

**Rounding Functions**:

22. `round(x)`: Rounds `x` to the nearest integer.
23. `round(x, n)`: Rounds `x` to `n` decimal places, where `n` is an integer.

You can use these operators and functions in Python to perform a wide range of numerical calculations and comparisons.
